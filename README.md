# TelecomX

Project Overview
I have been hired as a Data Analysis Assistant at Telecom X for the "Customer Churn" project. The goal is to address high cancellation rates by identifying the key drivers of customer loss.

Using Python, I am responsible for the end-to-end data workflow—from collection to analysis—providing the foundation for the Data Science team to build predictive models and retention strategies.

What I will practice:
API Integration: Efficient data import and manipulation.

ETL Pipeline: Applying Extract, Transform, and Load concepts.

Data Visualization: Building strategic charts to spot trends.

EDA: Performing Exploratory Data Analysis and reporting insights.
